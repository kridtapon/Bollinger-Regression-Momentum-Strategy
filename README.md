# Bollinger-Regression-Momentum-Strategy

Before diving into the code, it's essential to understand the two main components of the strategy:
1.Bollinger Bands: Bollinger Bands are a popular tool used to measure market volatility. They consist of:
Upper Band: The moving average plus a set number of standard deviations.
Lower Band: The moving average minus the same number of standard deviations.

These bands expand and contract as volatility increases or decreases in the market, providing insights into potential breakout points.
2.Linear Regression Slope: The linear regression slope helps to identify the trend of a stock price over a certain window. It shows whether the price is generally increasing or decreasing, providing a sense of momentum.
